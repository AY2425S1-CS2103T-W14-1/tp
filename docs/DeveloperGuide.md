## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `mark -s 1 active`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagramMarkSupplier.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SupplierListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `DeliveryListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Supplier`  and `Delivery` object(s) residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete -s 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSupplierSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -s 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteSupplierCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteSupplierCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteSupplierCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a supplier).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `DeleteSupplierCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `DeleteSupplierCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddSupplierCommandParser`, `DeleteSupplierCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Supplier` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueSupplierList` object).
*The model stores the Supplier objects in 2 separate lists. FilteredSupplierList holds the Supplier objects after applying a filter based on some criteria. SortedSupplierList holds the Supplier objects after sorting them according to a specified criterion. A boolean flag controls which list is exposed to outsiders (e.g., the UI). Depending on the flag, one of the 2 lists will be exposed as an unmodifiable ObservableList<Supplier> that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Supplier` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Supplier` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th supplier in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new supplier. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the supplier was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the supplier being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

2. The application should take no longer than 5 seconds to launch and load all necessary data (e.g., contacts, deliveries) on any supported platform.

#### Scalability Requirements
3. The system should be able to handle at least 100 contacts and 200 deliveries without noticeable degradation in performance

#### Usability Requirements
4. A user with typing speed of more than 50 words per minute for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse

#### Compatibility / Portability Requirements
5. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 17 or above installed without requiring platform-specific dependencies
6. The product should work as a standalone JAR file, not exceeding 100MB in size without needing an installer.

#### Data Requirements

### Glossary

* **Breadth-first Incremental Manner**: An approach to software development where features are implemented across the entire scope of the project in shallow layers, gradually adding depth and complexity over time. This method ensures that all major components of the system are developed in parallel, allowing for early integration and testing of the overall system structure.
* **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**: A text-based interface where users interact with the system by typing commands, as opposed to using a graphical interface with mouse clicks.
* **CRUD Operations**: Refers to Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. In this system, CRUD applies to managing supplier contacts and delivery information.
* **DBMS (Database Management System)**: A software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to a database. It provides an organised way of managing, storing, and retrieving vast amounts of data.
* **Delivery Information**: Details about a specific delivery, including date, supplier, products, and status.
* **Human-Editable File**: A plain text file that can be easily opened, read, and modified by users, typically in formats such as JSON, CSV, or TXT, without needing specialised software.
* **JAR File**: A Java ARchive file, which is a package file format that aggregates many Java class files and associated resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution.
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS
* **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: A programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and methods.
* **Supplier Contact**: A record containing information about a supplier, including name, contact details, and associated products.
* **Unit and Integration Testing**:
  * **Unit Testing**: A software testing method where individual units or components of the software are tested in isolation to ensure they work correctly. 
  * **Integration Testing**: A phase of software testing where individual software modules are combined and tested as a group to verify that they work correctly together.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Enhancement 1**: Make deletion of suppliers with pending deliveries throw a warning and error message.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to delete suppliers with pending deliveries without any warning. 
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add a warning message when a user tries to delete a supplier with pending deliveries.
     * e.g. "Warning: Unable to delete supplier. There are pending deliveries associated with this supplier."


2. **Enhancement 2**: Make marking an active supplier with pending deliveries inactive throw a warning and error message.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to mark active suppliers with pending deliveries as inactive without any warning.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add a warning message when a user tries to mark an active supplier with pending deliveries as inactive.
     * e.g. "Warning: Unable to mark supplier as inactive. There are pending deliveries associated with this supplier."
     

3. **Enhancement 3**: Allow users to create their own units for quantity of products.
   * **Description**: The current implementation only allows for a fixed set of units for quantity of products (e.g. kg, g, l, ml). 
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to allow users to define their own units for quantity of products.
     * e.g. "add -d on/18-01-2023 15:00 s/1 pro/bread q/500 customUnit c/5.50"
     

4. **Enhancement 4**: Make adding a delivery of a product that is not supplied by the supplier throw a warning and error message.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to add a delivery of a product that is not supplied by the supplier without any warning.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add a warning message when a user tries to add a delivery of a product that is not supplied by the supplier.
     * e.g. "Warning: Unable to add delivery. The product is not supplied by the selected supplier."
     

5. **Enhancement 5**: Make adding supplier tags check for duplicates case-insensitively and throw a warning message.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to add duplicate tags with different case (e.g. "friends" and "Friends").
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to check for duplicate tags case-insensitively and throw a warning message.
     * e.g. "Warning: Duplicate tag 'friends' already exists. Please use a different tag."
     

6. **Enhancement 6**: Make mark supplier command less sensitive to spacing for consistency.
   * **Description**: The current implementation is not sensitive to spacing in other commands but is sensitive to spacing in the mark supplier command.
   * e.g. "mark -s 1 active" is allowed and "mark -s1 active" is not allowed. 
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to make the mark supplier command less sensitive to spacing for consistency.
     * e.g. "mark -s 1 active" and "mark -s1 active" should have the same effect.


7. **Enhancement 7**: Make upcoming command throw an error when the date and time input for the `aft/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` parameter is later than the date and time input for parameter `bef/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME`.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to key in an invalid date range for PENDING deliveries for the upcoming command without any warning.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add an error message when a user tries to use the upcoming command with an invalid date range where the `bef/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` parameter has an earlier date and time than the `aft/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` parameter.
     * e.g. "Warning: `The DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` value for the `aft/ DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` parameter should be earlier than the value for `bef/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME`."


8. **Enhancement 8**: Allow for adding a supplier name with special characters.
   * **Description**: The current implementation only allows for alphanumeric characters in the supplier name.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to allow for adding a supplier name with special characters.
     * e.g. "add -s n/John Doe & Sons p/98765432


9. **Enhancement 9**: Better input checks for invalid date in commands that require date input.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows for certain invalid dates
    because the LocalDateTime module automatically converts the date to the first previous valid date
   * e.g. "add -d on/31-04-2023 15:00 s/1 pro/bread q/500 g c/5.50" (For months with less than 31 days,
   the date is converted to the last day of the previous month)
   * No error message is shown.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add better input checks for invalid dates in commands that require date input.


10. **Enhancement 10**: Allow finding deliveries by date and time range.
   * **Description**: The current implementation only allows finding deliveries by a single date and time.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to allow users to find deliveries within a specified date and time range.
     * e.g. "find -d aft/18-01-2023 12:00 bef/18-01-2023 18:00 stat/DELIVERED"
